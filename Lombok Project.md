!Lombok Project:
Project Lombok (from now on, Lombok) is an annotation-based Java library that allows you to reduce boilerplate code. Lombok offers various annotations aimed at replacing Java code that is well known for being boilerplate, repetitive, or tedious to write. For example, by using Lombok, you can avoid writing constructors with no arguments, toString(), equals(), and hashCode() methods by simply adding a few annotations. The magic happens during the compile-time when the library injects the bytecode representing the desired and boilerplate code into your .class files. Plus, as we will see, the library can be plugged into your IDE, letting you have the same experience as if you had written all the boilerplate code yourself.
